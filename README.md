# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

An html file connected to a js file is included in the code. -The html file is organized into a body with a straightforward header, a tiny paragraph, and a button that links to the gradeGenerator() function in the js file and prompts the user to enter a mark. When clicked, the function is carried out. -The grade will be printed in the js file, which is linked from the last paragraph of the html file with the id="grade".

-he function gradeGenerator is first declared in the js file, and a variable called "mark" is declared there to urge the user to input a mark. -If the mark entered is more than 100 or is not a number, an alert telling the user to "please enter a valid number for your mark" is sent to them. -The grading system's if else statement is as follows. A sentence is produced based on the mark that was entered.

B: 60 to 79, C: 59 to 49, D: 40 to 49, E: less 40. A: greater than 79.

**Student Grader**
This generates student grade based on marks awarded

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
**Speed Detector**
This is for speed ticketing

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
